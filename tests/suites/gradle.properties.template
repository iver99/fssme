# DESCRIPTION
# Template file to dynamically generate gradle.properties
#
# NOTES
# 1. This file is a template for dynamically generating gradle.properties file for <lrg>.gradle; It must only
# contain the list of property names (NOT values), one per line.
# 2. The gradle.properties file will be created under $REPO_ROOT/tests/suites (as per gradle requirement).
# 3. This file (the template file) should contain name of the properties which are common across all lrgs
# Each line in this template file (which does not begin with '#') represent a project property which needs
# to be populated with actual value in the resultant gradle.properties file.
# 4. If any lrg specific property to be included in the generated 'gradle.properties', it must be included in
# $REPO_ROOT/tests/suites/<lrgName>.gradle.properties (create file if not already exist.)
# a) this is not template file which only has property names. It must be a properties file with key=value pair.
# b) IF this file has same key as in gradle.properties.template, the value in <lrg>.gradle.properties always
# takes precedence
# 5. After the LRG execution completes, the $REPO_ROOT/tests/suites/gradle.properties is moved to $T_WORK
# so as to be made available in farm results.
# The file is moved, also to ensure 'git' does not recognize it as untracked file.
